tellraw @s [{"text":" In this minigame, \"infected\" players chase other players to infect them. \"Sane\" players who die become infected themselves, even if they die from natural causes. The game starts with a mole in the sane team whose objective is to kill his teammates and start the \"infection\". ","color":"aqua"}]

tellraw @s [{"text":" The sane players glow so they cannot hide their position to the infected. The infected players do not glow and thus can sneak on the others. However, a warning message is shown to sane players if an infected is nearby. Sane players have a resistance II bonus if they stay close to each other. The mole gets 4 additional hearts (absorption II) for 30 seconds upon revealing oneself. ","color":"aqua"}]
