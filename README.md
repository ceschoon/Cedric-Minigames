You can start a game by clicking the green text [Start] in the minigame menu. For some minigames, you must first generate the map using the light blue text above [Start]. Detailed information is given if you click [Info].

You can always end a game prematurely by reloading the corresponding minigame by clicking the darker blue text [Reload] in the minigame menu. 
You can also pause a game by clicking the dark green text [Pause/Restart].
